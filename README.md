# Not yet cleaned Automic
Android Internal Automic Source Code - Made by iProgramInCpp, playingo.

- We dont care about credits. We just dont want to see videos like Kryptonware who make use of our work for money. So I republished this again.


TL;DR:

Automic was a worm and a mass botnet built for GT so that it keeps spreading and auto-advertising via SBs and boi did it infect a shitton of people :)
- Will use those accs to relaunch Growalts soon, that was the actual plan :D
