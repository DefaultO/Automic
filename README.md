# Not yet cleaned Automic
The original project was made by [iProgramInCpp](https://github.com/iProgramMC) & [Playingo](https://github.com/playingoDEERUX). Which of course turned out to be an Account Stealer for relaunching Growalts. Keep that in mind and don't praise them for that.

This project makes use of letting the game load their own library. I have never seen Dear Imgui getting used for Android Mod Menus before, which why I was interested in stuff like Exafarm and Automic the whole time. Guess because of them we will see menus like this pop up for not only Growtopia pretty soon, but also other mobile phone games.
